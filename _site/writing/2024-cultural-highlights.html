<h2 id="diamond-jubilee">Diamond Jubilee</h2>
<h3 id="album-by-cindy-lee">Album by Cindy Lee</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Cindy-Lee-Diamond-Jubilee.webp" alt="Diamond Jubilee by Cindy Lee Album Cover" /></p>

<p>If the medium is the message, then the message of Cindy Lee’s album “Diamond Jubilee”, available only via purchasing a zip file from a vaguely suspicious Web 1.0 Geocities site, was an invitation to start using iTunes again. It turns out that manually updating the cover artwork in the music-as-spreadsheet file management system and correcting wrongly applied metadata to have the tracks appear in the proper order within the 2-“disc” album, can elicit the same kind of nostalgic, almost tactile, satisfaction that vinyl collectors enjoy. It’s a sad state of affairs when a short respite from the de-experiential effects of music streaming feels so radical, but dragging over the included cover jpeg felt like an equivalent of the tactile satisfaction that vinyl collectors enjoy.</p>

<p>The music itself is captivating. Pop music as David Lynch sees it, a Phil Spector production from an alternate 20th century. Hauntology as affect: familiar, sometimes uncanny, with burdock hooks that stick to your trousers all day. It makes me feel like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jokermenpodcast/reel/C6OxzikxSUA/">Brian Wilson hearing Be My Baby for the first time</a>.

<h3 id="live-performance-by-a-mother-and-child-at-the-tate-modern-exhibition-yoko-ono-music-of-the-mind">Live performance by a mother and child at the Tate Modern exhibition “Yoko Ono: Music of the Mind”</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bag-piece.jpeg" alt="A performance of Bag Piece" /></p>

<p>Amongst the overwhelming volume of work in Yoko Ono retrospective at the Tate was a demarcated area of the gallery floor, with a large black bag hung up on a hook. Visitors were invited to perform their own “Bag Piece”, a work originally staged by Ono herself, in which the performer or performers are fully encased in a semi-flexible opaque bag, and are free to do whatever they want.</p>

<p>The experience of being inside the bag was powerful and multi-faceted, with onlookers enthusiastically describing mine and Anna’s performance as “good”. But our interpretation was followed by that of a mother and child, who stole the show.</p>

<p>Whilst mine and my partner’s joint performance was deemed “good” by onlookers, the following performance … A mother and child. Oscillating between being identifiable as two entities of different sizes and morphing into a unified power, they … For the finale, after some minimal conferring, the mum got down and curled up on the floor. The child carefully climbed and stood, like a victorious .. on a hill. Not a dry eye in the house.</p>

<p>Glastonbury is</p>

<p>The spell that is Glastonbury festival has many effects.</p>

<p>One of the personal effects of the spell that is Glastonbury festival is checking in with the mood of 200,000 people, and thereby the world at large, as it exists in late June of that particular year.</p>

<p>Much could be said about the rise and rise in popularity of “ambient” music and how it speaks to our current moment. Indeed, the music I’ve spent most time listening to this year has been minimalist and meditative, be it as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6eCHNoLWLO6U65q10bLv4b?si=72069ddd1c404f63">a soundtrack to working</a> or a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1JWUMFoEyA0ItqVgJPgBIz?si=8a13e06ebc7145c4">vehicle for transcendence</a>. But how can such a personal exprience be enabled and elevated by the greatest music festival in the world? It’s not giving brat.</p>

<p>New to Glastonbury Festival this year, the Tree Stage
Renaissance mushroom men Merlin and Cosmo Sheldrake.
Jon Hopkins album playback, transformative experience. But my festival highlight was James Burton of Warp Records playing a beatless mix accompanied by well-curated projections. Turning putting-youtube-on-at-the-afterparty into an artform.</p>

<p>… and as they ended perfectly in time: the audience responded entirely in sync: beat, gasp, enthusiastic applause.</p>

<p>But it was only on leaving the concert hall that it clicked. As the melodic rhythms of people, bikes and trams and the visual … intermingled. Oh, it’s about the city.</p>

<p>It’s official: Stockport is the new Stockport. 2024 saw the opening of a new bus station, connected by a huge sweeping walkway to the train station, and housing an urban park on the roof. Of the various identities I embody, one that fits very comfortably is that of “pedestrian”. And the pedestrian experience of Stockport Transport Interchange is magical. The huge oval cutout that exposes where the buses park up – this looks beautiful at night from the trains passing over the viaduct (one of the largest brick structures in the world) as they approach Stockport station.</p>

<p>Welcoming. Bee network.</p>

<p>No part of the structure is in denial about being located off the mighty A6, train track, canals, confluence of rivers, between shady tower blocks. It invites you to take in those surroundings, without pretending they’re conventionally beautiful. It truly embodies the town, capturing its multi-level nature: looking down at the buses below resembles peering over the bridge by the market to look at the Underbanks.</p>

<h2 id="magic-monthly">Magic Monthly</h2>
<h3 id="subscription-by-christian-grace">Subscription by Christian Grace</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/magic-monthly.jpg" alt="Christian Grace" /></p>

<p>Card magic is in a golden era. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean that a layperson like you is likely to see good card magic performed any time soon, IRL or otherwise. The advent of Patreon has made it financially viable to be a magician whose primary audience is other magicians. The key relationship is parasocial – audiences of “laypeople” need only be small groups of friends at pubs and coffee shops, whilst the trade is in the secrets themselves, not selling the performances to TV and theatres. And what secrets they are. The current cohort of London-based male magicians are absolutely next fucking level in terms of designing fooling tricks. Layering multiple methods into totally airtight routines that …</p>

<p>Some releases from this year deserving of praise include Andrew Frost’s knuckle-busting routines available via his own membership platform and various other outlets; fellow move-monkey Alex Hansford’s beautifully typeset “Missing Almost Every Thing”; Ross Tayler’s braggadocious and audacious approach to “reframing”; Ben Earl’s overpriced but as well as Derren Brown’s first book for magicians in twenty years, “Notes From A Fellow Traveller”. The latter is flying the flag for public performance and offering the <em>real</em> Real work.</p>

<p>But the greatest magic content this year is within Christian Grace’s subscription-based membership platform, Magic Monthly. Grace embodies the new model of effect design, where psychology, routining and mechanics combine to counteract each other. This is often paired with a degree of preparation that is totally deceptive in itself, in that no spectator would think that anyone would be arsed. The only thing missing, we might say, is that final frontier of magic: good taste. Do these performers have anything to <em>say</em>? Do they have a criteria for performing tricks that goes beyond being fooling and towards something artistic?</p>

<p>See Magic as Medium for an excellent look at magic’s common failings from semiotics, and how it so often fails as art. Derren Brown at least advocates for magic with a message but in the context of his overtly humanist, stoicist, atheist worldview, “meaning” is often trite or patronising. And he has much to answer for in terms of warping the public perception of what can and cannot be achieved through psychological manipulation. Even for the magician most highly thought of by other magicians, the actual strength lies firmly in the effects themselves.</p>

<p>I would like to see magic presented to the public that isn’t embarrassing or artistically compromised. But for now, who cares? Maybe you need to be me to appreciate it, but I am, and Christian Grace has offered me some of the most rewarding intellectual stimulation, and genuine delight, of 2024.</p>
